# Neovim

## TODO

### To Fix

- [ ] When the bufferline is closed, opening a file using telescope doesn't load the thing.
- [ ] Neotree disappears when hovering Neo-tree
- [ ] Bufferline disappears sometimes
- [ ] Bufferline Enter problem
- [ ] <Space>w doesn't show on which-key

### To Implement

- [ ] Message stack
- [ ] Language manager (polyglot)
- [ ] Figure out how noice and nvim-notify work
- [ ] Save all buffers (<Enter>S)
- [ ] (Neovide) Transparent title bar (if possible)
- [ ] (Neovide) Change the background color


### Foundamental

- [ ] Get the window config `nvim_win_get_config(win)`
