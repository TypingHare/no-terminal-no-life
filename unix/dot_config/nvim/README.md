# Neovim

### To Fix

- [ ] When the bufferline is closed, opening a file using telescope doesn't load the thing.
- [ ] Bufferline Enter problem (In some buffers, Enter doesn't work)
- [ ] <Space>w doesn't show on which-key
- [ ] Line numbers don't work sometimes
- [ ] Flash -> fail to work after using once -> fall back to the normal one
- [ ] Search problem (how to exit/clear search)
- [ ] Neo-tree width (Change the width on resize)
- [ ] Empty buffer problem (Close it when it is created?)

### To Implement

- [ ]
- [ ] Message stack
- [ ] Save all buffers (<Enter>S)
- [ ] (Neovide) Change the background color
- [ ] Make polyglot a mature module
- [ ] Format all files in a directory recursively (Neo-tree?)
- [ ] Refresh Neo-tree when lazygit is close
- [ ] Disable markdown auto preview (set keybindings to toggle it)

### To implement (but not important)

- [ ] Pressing multiple <leaders> will consider only one time

### Foundamental

- [ ] Get the window config `nvim_win_get_config(win)`
