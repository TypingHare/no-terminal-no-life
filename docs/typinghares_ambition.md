# TypingHare's Ambition

> Last updated at: Jun 21, 2025

In 2014, I compiled the first program using **Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0** in the age of 14. It was a simple and clumsy application similar to Pokedex, and it contains a bunch of monsters called JingLing I designed. Later, I became obsessed with writing all kinds of programs. It wasn't until 2017, I started to create my first web application using PHP when I was a freshman in Jinan University, where I was studying Packaging Engineering due to the adjustment system. In 2021, I immigrated (with the Permanent Resident Card) to the United States with my parents, and by the first time I got a chance to study computer science in classrooms.

As a nerdy person, I like studying pretty much, especially math and biology (I regard computer science as a branch of mathematics). As of 2025, I have created over 30 applications and libraries, either big or small. Often times, I can come up with many fancy ideas, and I often implement them immediately. However, over the years, I have been writing code aimlessly––No goals, just for fun. Fortunately, the years of programming experience have given me many insights, and I have gradually found a longer-term and clearer goal.

This plan contains all the applications I want to implement. I will update it at least one year to keep up with the times.

## Goals

- [No Terminal No Life](https://github.com/TypingHare/no-terminal-no-life) - A repository that contains all the configuration files in all the scenarios. It varies from system level configuration to small application configuration.
- [Burrow](https://github.com/TypingHare/burrow) - A framework/platform that allows developers to create terminal-based applications quickly.
- [Neodocs](https://github.com/TypingHare/neodocs) - A keyboard-based documentation browser web application.
- [Hare Forms](https://github.com/TypingHare/hare-forms) - A webpage that contains everything about me and also a gallery of all my applications.
