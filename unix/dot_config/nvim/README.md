# Neovim

## TODO

### To Fix

- [ ] When the bufferline is closed, opening a file using telescope doesn't load the thing.
- [ ] Neotree disappears when hovering Neo-tree
- [ ] Bufferline Enter problem
- [ ] <Space>w doesn't show on which-key
- [ ] Line numbers don't work sometimes
- [ ] Flash -> fail to work after using once
- [ ] Not automatically clear highlights
- [ ] Set up lua_ls with modules detection (if not, use lazy)
- [ ] Search problem (how to exit/clear search)
- [ ] Neo-tree width (Change the width on resize)
- [ ] Empty buffer problem (Close it when it is created?)

### To Implement

- [ ] Message stack
- [ ] Figure out how noice and nvim-notify work
- [ ] Save all buffers (<Enter>S)
- [ ] (Neovide) Transparent title bar (if possible)
- [ ] (Neovide) Change the background color
- [ ] Make polyglot a mature module
- [ ] Format all files in a directory recursively
- [ ] Refresh Neo-tree when lazygit is closed
- [ ] Disable markdown auto preview (set keybindings to toggle it)

### To implement (but not important)

- [ ] Pressing multiple <leaders> will consider only one time

### Foundamental

- [ ] Get the window config `nvim_win_get_config(win)`
